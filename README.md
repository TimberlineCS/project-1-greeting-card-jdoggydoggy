## Discussion
  * What problems did you have? What went well?  
	The project was tedious in the aspect of trial and error trying to figure out the correct pixel. Additionally figuring out the layering for each of the elements and the correct shape was difficult. 
	I did however really like the picture I was able to create. 
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
	I consulted my friends and online resources to be able to code the program
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
	There were general issues with compiling but most can be resolved with collaborating with others and using my resources. 
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
	Finding which shapes specifically was the most challening part of the challenge along with adding in the audio. 
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
	Getting down the rhythm of refreshing and trying out different values of pixels to get the picture I wanted.
